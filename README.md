# Formula1-Forms

Example form validations with [Superstruct](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/superstruct) and [React useRef](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useref)

- Describe layout of data for formula1 constructor, driver, race, and result

- Write assertions to proceed with valid data or add error messages to form fields

- Gather form field data with useRef

- Validate form data on form submit, not on every letter while typing (less re-rendering and works with Superstruct)
